# Comparisions of LLMs
Simple, first step asic comparisons of LLMs.
Comparision of pretrained LLMs and hosting them using Gradio.
Mainly doning the comparisions of pretrained open source models. 
These are few exapmles:
        'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat',  # Fully qualified model name
        'EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B',  # Corrected model name
        'facebook/bart-base'  # Potential alternative model

You can directly add the names of more model names (in line 25 of gradio_test.py) (if they are open-source and implemented on Hugging Face)
